#  Feature Extraction with the help of transfer learning(ResNet50)
We have the feature extraction code in this repository. This code uses ResNet50 to extract spatial features from video frames.
This code is used in these two papers: [Temporal Relations of Informative Frames in Action Recognition](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379714148_PDF_Temporal_Relations_of_Informative_Frames_in_Action_Recognition), [Adaptive Frame Selection In Two Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network Action Recognition](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/368726751_Adaptive_Frame_Selection_In_Two_Dimensional_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Action_Recognition
)
