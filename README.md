#  Feature Extraction with the help of transfer learning(ResNet50)
We have the feature extraction code in this repository. This code uses ResNet50 to extract spatial features from video frames.
This code is used in these two papers: [Paper 1]([https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379714148_PDF_Temporal_Relations_of_Informative_Frames_in_Action_Recognition)), [Paper 2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/368726751_Adaptive_Frame_Selection_In_Two_Dimensional_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Action_Recognition
)
